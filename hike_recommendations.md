# Hikes in Bavaria

## Easier Hikes

1. __Höllentalklamm__

    https://www.komoot.com/tour/45133083

Easy relaxed hike, with a restaurant at the end. One could lie down next to a stream coming from the Zugspitze glacier, nothing was more serene than that for me at the time I did that. 

2. __Eckbauer and Partnachklamm Loop__

    https://www.komoot.com/tour/45130632

    Easy, relaxed hike and the tour goes through Partnachklamm, and perfect for a hot summer day. It's also very short, and there are beautiful meadows to walk thorough.
At Eckbauer, you could also see King Ludwig II's Hunting Castle and there's a restaurant to get some refreshments.

3. __Reiderstein__

    https://www.komoot.com/tour/45131904
    
    Another short and easy hike. There's a restaurant towards the end of the hike, and it's perfect for an idle summer day.

4. __Jochberg__

    https://www.komoot.com/tour/45125137

    Super easy, and it's an very good mountain to start with. Absolutely no way to get lost, and the view from the summit is beautiful. 
It's next to Walchensee, if that is a point in it's favor. If you're new to hiking in the snow, you could start here, as it is short and the toughest part comes in only at the very end. 
Notes: Kochel is well connected to Munich, but the trains are few and far in between. The start point of the hike, Urfeld, is reachable by public transport (bus) from the Kochel train station. Just make sure you are back down in time to get back to either Kochel or better, Garmisch (the connectivity is better there) 
Beginner friendly: Yes

5. __Hirschberg__

    https://www.komoot.com/tour/45111126

    This was my first mountain that I tried climbing in Germany. It took me three tries to get to the summit, mostly due to inexperience, and getting lost the first time.
Tip: You will reach a point in the route where you'll have to choose "Winterweg" or "Sommerweg" : my recommendation is to choose the "Winterweg", and look behind you time to time, where you'll be treated to Lake Tegernsee in all her beauty. 
Time of year: The first time, it was late fall, the second time sometime in November, and the third, sometime in January. I loved the time I climbed it in January, the snow just the whole trip beautiful.
At the summit, the view is beautiful. 
Beginner friendly: Yes, no equipment needed in summer. If climbing in snow, get gloves, hiking poles, and spikes for your shoes.

6. __Wank__

    https://www.komoot.com/tour/45126675

    I would highly recommend climbing this mountain once you have some experience with snow.
And, please choose a day when the "Wankbahn" or the cable car is not working (there are a few weeks in winter), because otherwise it's a very crowded mountain. And please start early, the forest ways are beautiful (and empty) early morning, and it progressively gets more crowded as the day progresses.
Also, the path in the itinerary, is one I would highly recommend. 
The ascent will be more lonely, and it give you a taste of of heights, feeling a bit "exposed" but not really so much. 
But the summit cross at Eckenberg is lovely and is a must visit. Worth the trouble. But be careful! If you are not sure, reverse the direction of the hike, and once you get to the summit, come back the way you had gone up. 
But if you stick to the plan, and come back to the ground through Eckenhutte, you might catch the sunset behind Zugspitze there by the time you get down.
 It's a view that's spectacular, and usually, there's a lot of space to sit and watch it. I would highly recommend this! 
There's a restaurant at the top too.
How to get there: It's super well connected to Munich, and the trailhead is reachable by foot from the train-station.

## Medium level hikes - In order of difficulty 

1. __Leonhardstein__

    https://www.komoot.com/tour/45131474
    
    Short, but not easy. It's a black route, and it was one of the most difficult hikes I did at that time.
But do it for the views, they are out of the world. And you get to sit at the pointy tip of a the mountain.

    Tag: Scrambling, Exposed Sections near the Summit, Pyramidal Mountain, Descent can be dangerous
    Refreshments / Huts: No

2. __Roßstein__

    https://www.komoot.com/tour/45132125
    
    Long, but beautful during summer. The Tegernseer-hutte sits nuzzled between two mountains, and it's a sight to see.

    __Tags__: Scrambling route available, but there is a longer alternate route. 
    __Refreshments / Huts__: Yes

3. __Kramerspitz__

    https://www.komoot.com/tour/45132546
I did this hike in summer, and the Stepbergalm is a very good reason to do this hike. 
But the hike isn't easy, its on the T3 Swiss scale, it was one of the tougher hikes I've done.

Tags: Scrambling, short exposed sections secured with chains
Refreshments / Huts: Yes

[HARD] - More than 6/7 hours of hiking, in order of difficulty

Herzogstand, to Heimgarten and Ohlstadt
https://www.komoot.com/tour/45129504
This is not an easy hike, and it may not be possible in winter. I did this hike in late April, and it's the best time to do this, because there's still snow capped mountains all around you, but the trail is relatively snow-free.
This is a fantastic hike, and it includes a very long ridge walk. If you don't have a huge fear of heights, you could easily do it.
But if you have vertigo, I would recommend against it.
And the planned tour is long, really long. 
The last part of the tour is by a river, through winding forest roads. 

Tags: Ridge Walk, Beautiful views, Long hike
Refreshments / Huts: Yes

Neuschwanstein from Sauling
https://www.komoot.com/tour/45133651
Fantastic hike, can be done during summer. And what better way to end a hike than in the fairy-tale castle! 

Tags: T3 level Scrambling, nearly vertical rock scrambling, cross-country hiking 
Refreshments / Huts: Yes 

Schöttelkarspitze
https://www.komoot.com/tour/45134275
With a mountain that looks like a pyramid, the summit is motivation enough to do this exhausting, tiring hike

Tags: Exposed Sections (can be scary), Very long, Fair bit of scrambling
Refreshments / Huts: Yes 


Groß Arnspitze
https://www.komoot.com/tour/44781274

Very, very difficult. For me this was a combination of Leonharstein, Kramerspitz and Wank put together in one day. But the view at the top is the only reason to do this. 
This is not suitable for a first time hike, maybe we should do it only after sufficient experience. It took me around 9 hours to do it, with over 5 hours of ascent time.

Tags: (Long) Exposed Sections (can be very scary), Need to walk through the side of a mountain at 1800m, Very, very long hike, A lot of scrambling, Descent has a lot of scree.
Refreshments: No, but there is an unmanned hut near the summit.
